        <h3 id=my-name-is-colin-and-i-am-running-to-be-your-first-year-representative>My name is Colin, and I am running to be your First Year Representative!</h3>
        <p>I &rsquo;d like to be your first year representative in the CCSS, so I can collaborate with current members, as well as with Industry partners, to offer:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>more workshops,</li>
            <li>more coding challenges,</li>
            <li>and more events</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            As an off-campus student, one of the first things I &rsquo;d like to do is to <strong>coordinate a physical space on campus where students can attend their first year computer science lectures that have been moved online (1405 - sections A, B, C), by reaching out to Professors and the Computer Science department.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>I &rsquo;ll always be open to suggestions and feedback from fellow students on the types of activities and issues that are important to you.</p>
        <p>About me:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I live off campus and hate the 88</li>
            <li>
                I &rsquo;m passionate about AWS, <a href=https://github.com/colin-mccormack>my personal projects</a>
                , and soccer (specifically FC Bayern Munich)
            </li>
            <li>
                I like using JetBrains editors, and I &rsquo;m a big fan of the <a href=https://www.jetbrains.com/community/education/#students>JetBrains Student Program</a>
